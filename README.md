### What is ChatBottle?
[ChatBottle](https://chatbottle.co/?ref=github) is a tool to discover the best chatbots. It's like Google for chatbots.

You probably know thousands of developers are working on bots right now. In a few months, the market will be crowded and it will be much more difficult to find a chatbot. ChatBottle is one more channel to drive traffic to your bot. Integrate your bots with the API to join the club.
Whenever a bot receives or sends a message ChatBottle is notified. It allows to gather the data and measure how people actually use the bot. 
Based on the collected data ChatBottle ranks the bots.

### What is the Developer Platform?
The ChatBottle Developer Platform is a way for anyone to integrate their bot to ChatBottle. There are two main reasons for integrating:

1. ChatBottle Search drives a high-quality audience to you bot.
2. So that you can learn how your bots are used, review analytics and analyze conversations.

Integrating with ChatBottle is easy and should take a developer about a few minutes. What you need to do is just to **forward every message your bot sent and received to ChatBottle REST API**.  

### Why to integrate with ChatBottle?

ChatBottle is one more customer acquisition channel to drive traffic to your bot. Integration with ChatBottle allows to get news users and reactivate existing ones.

Promoting a chatbot with ChatBottle is cheaper than advertising, content marketing or SEO. Once the bot is integrated it will be automatically ranked and listed in ChatBottle Search.

### How it works?
Your bot forwards every message it sent or received to the ChatBottle API. The messages are analyzed by our ranking algorithms and the bot is ranked. 
ChatBottle bot rank works similar to Google PageRank. Itâ€™s important how people interact with a chatbot, how often and how helpful is the bot.

ChatBottle ranks bots based on retention and other metrics. Having not many but addicted users is a good sign for ChatBottle algorithms. As a result, your bot is ranked higher and more people discover it.

## Getting Started

1. Register at [chatbottle.co](https://chatbottle.co);
2. Register an existing chat bost at the dashboard;
3. Every time your bots send or receive a message call ChatBottle API. Use bot's unique generated **Authorization token** to make calls.

## API

### Schema
